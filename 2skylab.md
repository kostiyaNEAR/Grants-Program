# Mintbase Grant Proposal

- **Project Name:** 2SkyLab's NFT utility tools app
- **Team Name:** 2SkyLab
- **Payment Address:** 2skylabfund.near
- **[Level](../README.md#level_slider-levels):** 2

## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

- 2SkyLab brings together innovative technology with creative works, delivering products and experiences which are not only sensual, but also functional
- This particular project focuses on developing NFT utility tools which can be used by other Mintbase stores as an effort to answer one simple question - "Why would someone own an NFT as opposed to right click saving it's content?"
- Our project aims to build on top of the existing store functions, creating more functions in the form of tools, these tools will be available for specified mints on all mintbase stores, they can be applied to the respective mints by using our to be developed browser extension app, in support of our business model, the utility tools within our standalone app will be available to holders of a specific NFT (Key) minted on our 2skylab mintbase store.
- We are currently at a pivotal point in evolution of the digital environment, such times don't come accross all too often, the last significant era was the dot com boom. Today we are presented with the opportunity to shape this environment in the way that we believe would help bring the tech to the masses, it is at a very young stage and we acknowledge the hurdles that need to be overcome in order to make this happen. Our team is well prepared and has the necessary mindset/ experience to innovate this space in the right direction, we are determined to take on this challange and put in the needed effort to actualize NFTs with utility, positioning Mintbase as a core element in achieving mass adoption of meaningful NFT useage for both personal and business practices.

### Project Details

- Brief overview of the building plans 1. Mintbase intergration 2.1 Auto royalty tool 2.2 Fixed rate NFT tool (2.1 and 2.2 will be put together into a browser extension application)
  
1. Mintbase Integration -
Connect the mintbase sdk as well as other necessary JavaScript libraries.
The final result will be a progressive user interface to include the NEAR wallet login feature so users can authenticate for purchases.
All currently available resources under mintbase.js and mintbase UI will be integrated to our own domain, the only difference will be the BG image of the integrated mintbase pages, we will adapt our existing domain's bg image (renaissance painting with a zoom as you scroll fx). 

2.1 Royalties -
This tool will be built into a single react application with 2/3 pages. Also a multi-file smart contract to handle preminting and reissuing of NFT royalties to the first buyer of specified NFTs. 

2.2 Fixed rate NFT -
For this scenario we would build an oracle contract to manage the prices. To maintain fixed-rate we would employ the use of an automated market maker which will run on the blockchain and update NFT rates, depicting the price in NEAR. 

The above plans are designed to be utilized by NFT minters on Mintbase.io rather than buyers, they do however encompass benefits to NFT buyers and also serve as an incentive to onboard more businesses to the Mintbase ecosystem, advertising NFTs as utility tools rather than mere assets.

### Ecosystem Fit

- We position ourselves as an organization focusing on 2 areas, 1 being NFT utility tool developers, and 2 being fine arts curators. Our 2nd focal point is generally used to demonstrate our works in the 1st focal point, for example, we onboard artists to 2SkyLab and help them disseminate their art in the form of NFTs that embody the utility tools we will develop and in this process demonstrate the different ways NFTs can be used in social and economic dynamics.
- Fellow mintbase stores, established businesses in Hong Kong seeking to adapt web3 technology, art collectors, individuals with no knowledge in the web3 space.
- NFT utility developement - This is a crucial point in demonstrating to people and businesses, how NFT technology can be used in ways to benefit b2b and b2c models. The current state of NFT has people believing in nothing more than speculative investments, we want to change this by demonstrating that NFTs are actually tools and can be fit to various economic environments.
- Various projects are releasing phygital NFTs, various projects are developing tools to enhance the mintbase store experience, however I haven't found any projects that are focusing specifically on developing NFT utility tools and showcasing their use through their phygital/ digital NFTs, whilst implementing the mintbase js/ ui to their own domains. We also have not found any other projects developing the specified utility tools that we want to create.
  - Our project is different because the main goal of our NFT utility tools are directed not only to other Mintbase stores but also to established (traditional) businesses as a way to showcase the ways in which we can begin using NFT technology in modern business practices, by doing so we are not only bringing value to the Mintbase ecosystem but are in line with NEAR protocol's aim for mass adoption, all whilst onboarding organizations and individuals through a truly useful means to participate in the NFT space. This sets up a great opportunity to funnel outside investments in order to keep building on top of Mintbase, enriching NEAR protocol and bringing in more traffic.

## Development Status :open_book:

Project has not commenced developement at this stage. We have been in touch with regards to the tool developement ideas with Mintbase representatives and our first step would be intergrating the mintbase store to our website 2skylab.com. Upon the intergration we will begin developing the tools and embody them into a single browser extension app, for the ask of this grant we are seeking to develop 2 tools which can be used on other mintbase stores through a browser extenstion app. This would be available to holders of specific NFTs sold on our store, otherwise the code is open source and could be implemented by other projects on their own terms. This standalone app will become a work in progress, with time and progress including more of our utility tools we will have developed.

## Future Plans

- Short term, we plan to promote the mintbase marketplace and the utility tools we have developed to attempt to bring in more traffic to the Mintbase ecosystem. We will promote our utility tools to other mintbase stores through our social accounts, personal connections and NEAR based announcements. We plan to host events to showcase our devised NFT utility to the general public and potential investors, showcasing the benefits of owning our mints (such as auto royalties to first buyer), onboarding new users to NEAR (by helping them set up NEAR wallets and funding those from event tickets) and taking on partenrships with established businesses in Hong Kong. We are aiming to appeal to businesses by promoting fixed rate NFT functionality + encouraging them to set up their own Mintbase stores and implement our NFT utility tools as a way to meaningfully engage in the evolution of web3 and blockchain. We are honing in on the 'FOMO', but instead of merely monetizing this aspect, we want to offer a meaningful means for businesses to incorporate NFT and web3 apps to their own business practices, positioning mintbase and our utility tools as the perfect way to jump on board.
- In the long term, we plan to develop more NFT utility tools and add them to the standalone app, prior, we will need to undergo the development of the tools described in the milestones above, taking into consideration all the difficulties encountered in the process. This is something new to our team and we are taking on a learning curve, we don't want to over extend our ambitions but are sincerely willing to position ourselves as key players in developement of NFT utility tools pertaining to the Mintbase/ NEAR ecosystem. Upon completion of Milestone 2.4 we will begin to draw out further NFT utility tools. Down the line we plan to innovate our standalone app with NFT utility tools towards compatibility not only with other stores on Mintbase but also other NFT standards and markeplaces, truly living up to the LAB' part of our company name.

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

- Thus far we have received funding from Mintbase DAO to startup our store, to this date we have released one collection of NFTs, this is a phygital collection featuring works of the infamous rockstar graphic designer Ruby Mazur, we are currently working on releasing the second collection with HK based sketch artist The Ink Trail, furthermore we have artworks ready from a famous HK artist Anna Salenko. We plan to host our second event towards the end of July to showcasse the releases and announce further releases, in this event we want to use some of the profits from ticketing in order to fund NEAR wallets for our attendees and engage them to receive/ buy NFTs from our store. We are in the talks with local NFT startups as(Whub) in attempts to devise a collaboration utilizing their Decentraland land, we are also pending to join a local NFT exhibition ARTAVERSE to gain exposure to external investors and industry specialists from Hong Kong. We have also talked with Hang Seng Bank to help them design NFTs, we are currently awaiting their response, ideally we can present the tools we outlined above as an incentive for them to open their own Mintbase store to meaningfully adapt the current web3 trends. We also partnered with a local firm The Rose Rituals on a project called ForkX, which is an NFT pop up museum in randomized locatations around Hong Kong, first event is scheduled for November 2022, details are being worked on as I am writing this grant proposal.
